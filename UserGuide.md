# Loot Tracker User Guide
## Introduction
Welcome to the Loot Tracker! This tool gives people the capability to track their own drops from the Chamber of Xeric, a raid in the MMORPG Oldschool Runescape.
After tracking your drops, you have a few different ways of visualizing just how lucky, or unlucky, your account has been so far.

## Main Menu
Upon loading up the application, you will be greeted with a few different options. The Submit, Compare, and Log button all take you to different menus.
The Submit button will take you to a scene for you to submit new drops as you get them. The Compare button will take you to a scene where you can visually compare
the previous drops you have obtained with two different methods. The Log button takes the user to a scene where some general diagnostic information is held.

## Submit Menu
This menu is how the user interacts with their drop database (a CSV file stored locally). On the top of the scene are instructions for how to submit, but this user
guide will also detail that. On the left side of the scene are buttons for each type of object you can submit; only one object can be chosen at a time. In the middle of
the scene are you submission options. The "Kill Count Obtained" field takes an integer value; if any other value or word is passed in the object will not be added
to your database. Toggle boxes "Challenge Mode", "Obtained Solo", and "Personally Obtained" are all assumed to be false unless ticked. Pressing the submit button will
take each of these values and create a new Loot object for your database. At the bottom of the screen is a button to return to the main menu.
